title: Generative
---

"Generative" is a broad term for processes that utilize computer simulations,
often involving randomness, to produce a work of some kind.

When I use the word [[Generative]], I am usually talking about utilizing
procedural generation for some creative endeavor. Most commonly for me, that
medium is visual artwork.
