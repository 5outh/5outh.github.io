I realized this morning that I don't have links to any of this external-but-relevant stuff anywhere on the site,
and I want to change that just to keep everything in one place!

Last year, I wrote a guest post on Stack Overflow's hiring blog about my preferred technical interviewing strategy.
[You can read about the project walkthrough technique here.](https://www.stackoverflowbusiness.com/blog/interviewing-a-developer-try-the-project-walkthrough-technique)

I have a YouTube channel! I ran a series called "Breakfast Bash" here containing little blurbs about basic computer science concepts.
There's also a three hour Haskell workshop VOD put together by me and Matt Parsons. [You can see that here.](https://www.youtube.com/user/5outhSix)

I gave a talk at the Developers of Athens Meetup Group about Lockhart's Lament and how it applies to
programming. [The slides are here](/pdfs/lockharts-lament.key); I would love to give this talk again to a larger crowd.

That's all for now! Just some stuff I wanted to consolidate.
